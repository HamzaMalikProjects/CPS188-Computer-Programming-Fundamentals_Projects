## 📘 Course Overview

CPS188 introduces students to the fundamentals of computer programming with an emphasis on structured problem-solving and engineering applications. Using the C language, students learn core concepts including control structures, recursion, dynamic memory management, file I/O, and modular program design.

The course emphasizes clean, well-documented code, algorithmic efficiency, and real-world engineering problem modeling through hands-on labs and a term project.

## Topics Covered:
- Algorithm development and flow control  
- Functions, pointers, arrays, and matrices  
- String manipulation and recursion  
- File input/output and binary data handling  
- Structures, dynamic memory, and user-defined libraries  
- Modular programming and reusable code practices
